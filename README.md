##Inspiration<br>
We often feel overwhelmed as students and find it difficult to take a break from our studies. We were motivated to create this Chrome extension because we thought a solution like this would benefit our peers and anyone who spends a lot of time on their gadgets, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>
##What it does<br>
The home tab has the "daily journal," which allows the user to record their daily emotions and activities, as well as a new inspiring quote every time the user reopens the extension. The activities area contains information on stretching, yoga, and posture suggestions for users who spend the majority of their day working at a computer. Finally, the mindfulness page shows a variety of guided meditations and Spotify playlists for various purposes, such as studying with natural sounds, more guided meditations, and relaxing with peaceful songs.

##How we built it<br>
The original layout of the app was sketched on paper first and then changed. The vision was then transferred to a digital format using InVision Studio. On the coding end, the extension was built largely with HTML and some JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and collaborating through Github.

<br>
##Challenges we ran into<br>
Some of the coding issues we encountered were related to the timer feature, which was the foundation of the original extension. The original plan was for the user to choose a predetermined time interval (20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, or 3 hours), and the extension would run in the background, sending a "nudge" with a motivational message and a reminder to stretch, do some yoga, or suggest a quick exercise every time that time interval passed.
However, due to an unresolved bug, we decided to abandon it in favour of a "daily diary" feature that would allow the user to enter their emotions and feelings into the extension along with the date, and then store the entry to their computer. However, even after hours of troubleshooting, we ran into another error that prevented us from saving the file to the user's computer. As a result, we've opted to present the programme as is, with the goal of developing and improving these features in the future.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of <br>
We are proud that we figured out how to develop a fully functional extension that runs and has interactive features (clickable links and video, interactive tabs).

<br>
##What we learned
<br>
We learnt that a vision or plan does not always go as planned, especially when it comes to coding (due to time limits, project complexity, or other factors beyond our control), thus it's necessary to change and come up with a backup plan. We learnt how to make a Google extension as well as how to search the internet for functions, methods, and tools to use in our code that we may not have previously encountered.
